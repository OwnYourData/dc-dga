# DGA Orchestration Frontend

This repository provides the frontend implementation for **Data Intermediary** and **Data Altruism Organisation DAO** services developed under the **EU Data Governance Act (DGA)** framework.  
It delivers user-facing components that enable individuals and organizations to manage data sharing, consent, and altruistic data contributions in a **transparent, trusted, and human-centric** manner.

---

## 🧩 Overview

The frontend serves as the **interaction layer** for DGA-compliant data network services, allowing users to:

- Manage member accounts
- View, create, and revoke **data sharing consents**  
- Contribute to and participate in **data altruism initiatives**  
- Access dashboards for **data access requests, audit trails, and credentials**  
- Interact with **wallets** and **verifiable credentials** through secure OID4VCI / OID4VP flows  

It is designed to be modular, adaptable, and compatible with multiple backend environments (e.g., Data Intermediary Platform, DAO Archive).
